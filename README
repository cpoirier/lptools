HISTORY
-------

This is a literate programming environment I wrote back in 2002/2003.  I wrote
it for a long abandonned O/S project I was mucking with, at the time.  The 
code worked, when last run (a long time ago), but there was a bug with the 
build tool and subprojects, as I recall.  I've moved the code here from 
its original repository at lptools.tigris.org for the sake of consolidating
my open source stuff, but please note I haven't touched this code in a very
long time, and have no plans to touch it again.

Still, the build tool was kind of neat. :-)  See the wiki for details.
