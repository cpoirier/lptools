1.03b
-----
Added build programming tutorial.  Oops.


1.03 lp system
--------------
Ditched 3-level version numbers.

Added lpblocks command that lists block names found in an lp file.

@-transclude and @-include can now reference blocks, as well as whole files.

lpcc no longer automatically comments transcluded blocks that differ in 
language.  Instead, you now supply the comment marker directly in your code.
This change has two effects:
   * single line blocks can be transcluded inline intuitively
   * the lpcc code no longer has to know the comment marker for your language
My apologies to anyone who liked the old behaviour...
Example:
   //  {{a comment}}  //

Fixed miscellaneous small bugs and improved error trapping.



1.03 build
----------

Alternate target directories now actually work.

Added (build-target), which can build targets during production rules.  This 
allows the build system to be used to update caches of production information 
without resorting to multiple passes. 

Added (def-source) function that allows code to be run on a source node before
it is run through the production engine.

Fixed (def-zone) to load its environment from the parent zone, not the global
environment, allowing data to be passed from one zone to another (on creation).

Added (exists?) function to check for file existence.

Added (pipe-out) function to send data to an external program.

Added (wildcard-glob) function to get a list of matching filenames from the
file system.

Fixed miscellaneous small bugs and improved error trapping.



1.0.2
-----

Added @-no-markup and @-cancel-markup directives to the lp tools.

Added @-transclude directive and fixed @-include and @-inherit to consistently
handle embedded paths.

Fixed a bug in build that dropped second and later dependencies.

Fixed miscellaneous other small bugs.
