DESCRIPTION
-----------

This example, for the lptools suite (http://lptools.tigris.org), shows the
basics of using the lp system and build.  It is licensed under the Open Software
License, version 1.1.



DETAILS
-------

hello-world.lp is an example of a lp source file, and two source files are
generated from it (by way of lpcc):
   * Buildfile
   * hello-world.c

The Buildfile included in this example is generated from hello-world.lp.  You
would not typically do this in your systems, as Buildfile must be built before
you can invoke build.  It is done this way here simply so the Buildfile code
can be discussed in a literate style.

Steps:
   * read hello-world.lp, which describes the lp and build systmems in brief

   * have a look at Buildfile

   * run build to generate:
      * hello-world.xml  (generated from hello-world.lp by lpdoc)
      * Buildfile        (generated from hello-world.lp by lpcc )
      * hello-world.c    (generated from hello-world.lp by lpcc )
      * hello-world      (generated from hello-world.c  by gcc  )

   * have a look at hello-world.xml

   * have a look at hello-world.c

   * optionally run hello-world (at your own risk!!!)
